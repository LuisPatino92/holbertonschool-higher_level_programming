# Holberton School Project

>This repo is part of the Holberton School curriculum.

## 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions

The goal with this project is to learn about the basic statements available to write code in Python3. The tasks given as Holberton School's project, are aimed to be solved using:

- if, elif, else.
- while, for.
- break, continue.
- pass.
- Own written functions.

## In this REPO:

>**0-positive_or_negative.py**

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

>**1-last_digit.py**

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

>**2-print_alphabet.py**

Program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line, with some conditions to abide:

- Only one print.
- Only one loop.
- No allowed to store chars in any variable.
- No allowed to import any module.

>**3-print_alphabt.py**

Program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line, with some conditions to abide:

- Print all the letters except q and e.
- You can only use one print function with string format.
- You can only use one loop in your code.
- No allowed to import any module.
- You are not allowed to store characters in a variable.

>**4-print_hexa.py**

Program that prints the number from 0 to 98, with a format.

>**5-print_comb2.py**

Program that prints the number from 0 to 99, with a format.

>**6-print_comb3.py**

Program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits, with no repetition and with a format.

>**7-islower.py**

Function that checks for lowercase character.

>**8-uppercase.py**

Function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

>**9-print_last_digit.py**

Program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.

>**101-remove_char_at.py**

Function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).

>**102-magic_calculation.py**

Function based on the following bytecode:

	3       0 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
		3 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
		6 COMPARE_OP               0 (<)
